# 🔧 Chat Functionality Fix - RESOLVED

## 🎯 Problem Identified
**Issue**: Chat functionality was not working in the frontend interface
**Root Cause**: The `chat.js` file containing the `sendMessage()` function was not being loaded in the chat template

## 🔍 Diagnosis Process

### ✅ Backend Testing
- **API Functionality**: ✅ Working correctly
- **Euron API Integration**: ✅ Connected and responding
- **Django Views**: ✅ All endpoints functional
- **Database Operations**: ✅ Messages being saved properly
- **User Authentication**: ✅ Working as expected

### ❌ Frontend Issue Found
- **Missing Script**: `chat.js` was not loaded in the chat template
- **JavaScript Functions**: `sendMessage()` function was undefined in browser
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Template had fallback code but main functionality was missing

## 🛠️ Solution Applied

### **File Modified**: `templates/chat/home.html`
**Change Made**: Added missing script tag to load chat.js

```html
<!-- Load chat functionality -->
<script src="{% static 'js/chat.js' %}"></script>
```

**Location**: Added at the end of the template, just before `{% endblock %}`

## ✅ Verification Results

### **Backend Test Results** (`test_chat_functionality.py`)
